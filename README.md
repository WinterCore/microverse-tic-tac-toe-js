# TIC TAC TOE

> This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented to demonstrate the use of javascript for interactivity and responsiveness in making a functioning game as follows:

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. Player 1 is X, Player 2 is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. When all 9 squares are full without a winner, the game is a draw.
